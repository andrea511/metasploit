    <p>
      A penetration tester’s worst nightmare is to crash a production system by selecting the wrong exploit.
      Metasploit Pro’s auto exploitation feature reduces the risk of impacting production systems by minimizing
      human error.
    </p>

    <p>
      Auto exploitation intelligently selects exploits that are suitable for the discovered target and is a key
      component to safely conduct penetration tests on production systems. If a host is matched with several exploits,
      the exploit that is the most specific to the fingerprinted system is used first, increasing the success rate and
      speed of compromise. Unlike with manual exploitation, all exploits can be selected and launched at the same time.
