  The Nexpose and import configuration pages have been recently updated.
  Both tasks now have a new workflow, which streamlines the import of data from Nexpose, Metasploit,
  and third-party vendors. Due to these changes, you must reconfigure any task chain that contains a legacy Nexpose
  or import task. For more information on these changes, see the release notes.
