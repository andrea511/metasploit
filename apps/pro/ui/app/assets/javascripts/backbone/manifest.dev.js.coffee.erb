# This file is used only as a "watcher" file in development mode. It is never
# served to the client, but allows us to dynamically reload the require_config
# at the right moment (e.g., when the contents of any subdirectory change).
#

#
# We prevent this file from ever actually being compiled, as this would bloat
# our updater/installer sizes unnecessarily.
#

#
# We can't require_tree ./ because it will induce a circular dependency :(
# For some reason the #stub directive does not save us here...
# So instead we require the subdirectories in ./ one-by-one, awesome.

#= require_tree './apps'
#= require_tree './entities'
#= require_tree './lib'
