 is obligated to pay such tax, and Rapid7 will receive the full payment, net of
 any such taxes, as agreed on the applicable Product Order Form.  Customer shall

 VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.
 .
 6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY
 REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, IN NO EVENT WILL RAPID7

 7. USAGE VERIFICATION
 .
 Customer understands and acknowledges that the Software may track and/or
 enforce its usage limits, including but not limited to license keys, user
 counts, and other technical enforcements of license limitations. Additionally,
 Rapid7 may make a written request, such request not to exceed once every six
 (6) months, upon which request Customer shall provide Rapid7 with a signed
 certification verifying that the Software is being used pursuant to the
 provisions of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, at Rapid7's written
 request, Customer will permit Rapid7 to review and verify Customer's records,
 deployment and use of the Software for compliance with the terms and conditions
 of this Agreement, at Rapid7's expense.  Any such review shall be scheduled at
 least ten (10) days in advance, shall be conducted during normal business hours
 at Customer's facilities, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's
 business activities.
 .
 8. CONFIDENTIALITY
 .
 8.1 Confidential Information.  During the term of this Agreement, each party
 will regard any information provided to it by the other party and designated in
 writing as proprietary or confidential to be confidential ("Confidential
 Information"). Confidential Information shall also include information which,
 to a reasonable person familiar with the disclosing party's business and the
 industry in which it operates, is of a confidential or proprietary nature.  A
 party will not disclose the other party's Confidential Information to any third
 party without the prior written consent of the other party, nor make use of any
 of the other party's Confidential Information except in its performance under
 this Agreement.  Each party accepts responsibility for the actions of its
 agents or employees and shall protect the other party's Confidential
 Information in the same manner as it protects its own valuable confidential
 information, but in no event shall less than reasonable care be used. The
 parties expressly agree that the Software and the terms and pricing of this
 Agreement are the Confidential Information of Rapid7.   The receiving party
 shall promptly notify the disclosing party upon becoming aware of a breach or
 threatened breach hereunder, and shall cooperate with any reasonable request of
 the disclosing party in enforcing its rights. The provisions of this Section
 8.1 will continue for a period of three (3) years after termination or
 expiration of this Agreement.
 .
 8.2 Confidentiality of Software. Rapid7 retains all right, title and interest
 in and to the Documentation, Software, Content Updates and in all copies,
 modifications and derivative works thereto including, without limitation, all
 rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other proprietary or
 intellectual property rights.  Customer will not and will not allow a third
 party to:  (i) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to
 derive, analyze or use any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms
 related to the Software by any means whatsoever, except and only to the minimal
 extent the provisions of this Section are expressly prohibited by applicable
 statutory law, (ii) except as expressly set forth herein, provide, lease, lend,
 use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use or allow others
 to use the Software to or for the benefit of third parties or (iii) remove any
 product identification, copyright or other notices or on any Software.
 Customer agrees to hold in confidence, not disclose, and not use the Software
 or the Content Updates except as expressly permitted herein.  The provisions of
 this Section 8.2 will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for
 any reason.
 .
 8.3 Exclusions.  Information will not be deemed Confidential Information
 hereunder if such information: (i) is known prior to receipt from the
 disclosing party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes known
 to the receiving party directly or indirectly from a source other than one
 having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (iii) becomes
 publicly known or otherwise publicly available, except through a breach of this
 Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party. The
 receiving party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the
 requirements of applicable law, legal process or government regulation,
 provided that it gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice to
 permit the disclosing party to contest such disclosure, and such disclosure is
 otherwise limited to the required disclosure.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 This Agreement or a Product Order Form may be terminated (a) by either party if
 the other party is adjudicated as bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is
 filed against the other party and such petition is not discharged within sixty
 (60) days of such filing, or (b) by either party if the other party materially
 breaches this Agreement or the Product Order Form and fails to cure such breach
 to such party's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days following
 receipt of written notice thereof.  Customer's license to use the Software
 shall also terminate upon the expiration of the applicable License Term.  Upon
 any termination of this Agreement or a Product Order Form by Rapid7, all
 applicable licenses are revoked and Customer shall immediately cease use of the
 applicable Software and certify in writing to Rapid7 within thirty (30) days
 after termination that Customer has destroyed or returned to Rapid7 such
 Software and all copies thereof. Termination of this Agreement or a license
 granted hereunder shall not limit either party from pursuing any remedies
 available to it, including injunctive relief, or relieve Customer of its
 obligation to pay all fees that have accrued, have been paid, or have become
 payable by Customer hereunder. All provisions of this Agreement which by their
 nature are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive
 such termination.
 .
 10. INDEMNIFICATION
 .
 10.1 Indemnification.  Rapid7 will defend and indemnify, at its own expense,
 any third party claim against Customer that arises due to a claim that the
 Software infringes any valid United States copyright or involves the
 misappropriation of a trade secret.  Rapid7 will pay such damages or costs as
 are finally awarded against Customer or agreed to in settlement for such claim
 provided that Customer gives Rapid7: (a) written notice of any such claim or
 threatened claim within ten (10) days of Customer being made aware of the claim
 or threat; (b) sole control of the defense, negotiations and settlement of such
 claim; and (c) full cooperation in any defense or settlement of the claim (at
 Rapid7's cost).  Rapid7 will not be liable for the settlement of a claim made
 without Rapid7's prior written consent.  If Customer's use of the Software
 results in, or in Rapid7's opinion is likely to become subject to a claim of
 infringement or misappropriation, then Rapid7 will, at its sole option and
 expense, either: (i) obtain for the Customer the right to continue using the
 Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it is non-infringing and
 substantially equivalent in function to, and interchangeable with, the
 infringing Software; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above cannot be
 accomplished despite the reasonable efforts of Rapid7, then Rapid7 may
 terminate Customer's rights to use the infringing Software.  When option (iii)
 is elected, Rapid7 will refund all collected license fees under this Agreement
 for the infringing Software on a monthly declining straight-line basis over a
 forty-eight (48) month period from delivery.  THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO CUSTOMER
 UNDER THIS SECTION 10 SHALL BE CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
 ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY THE SOFTWARE OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT OR OTHER
 PROPRIETARY RIGHT.
 .
 10.2 Exclusions.  Rapid7 shall have no obligation under this Section 10 with
 respect to any claim of infringement or misappropriation based upon: (i)
 combination of the Software with products, programs or data not furnished by
 Rapid7 where, but for the combination, the claim would have been avoided; (ii)
 any modification of the Software not performed by Rapid7, if such claim would
 have been avoided by use of the unmodified Software; (iii) compliance by Rapid7
 with Customer's custom requirements or specifications if and to the extent such
 compliance with Customer's custom requirements or specifications resulted in
 the infringement; or (iv) failure of Customer to use a replacement Software
 provided by Rapid7 to Customer in a timely manner to avoid such claim of
 infringement or misappropriation.
 .
 11. TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
 .
 11.1 Maintenance and Support Services.  Rapid7 offers multiple maintenance and
 support programs for the Software.  The maintenance and support program
 selected by Customer shall be as set forth on the applicable Product Order Form
 and shall be further subject to Rapid7's maintenance and support policies,
 copies of which are located at
 http://www.rapid7.com/docs/customers-support-guidebook.pdf
 .
 11.2 Professional Services.  Rapid7 may provide Customer certain professional
 services, such as installation, configuration, consulting, training,
 penetration testing, and external scanning, if and as specified on a Product
 Order Form or a separate statement of work (SOW) executed by the parties. All
 changes to an SOW must be approved by both parties in writing.  Unless
 otherwise provided on a Product Order Form or SOW, Customer is responsible for
 installing and configuring all Software.  Rapid7 shall have sole discretion in
 staffing the professional services and may assign the performance of any
 portion of the professional services to any subcontractor; provided that Rapid7
 shall be responsible for the performance of any such subcontractor. Customer
 shall designate at least one employee with knowledge of Customer's business and
 Rapid7's technology and services as its primary contact to be available for
 communication with Rapid7 in providing the professional services. Customer will

 will not (i) assume any responsibility for determining the purposes for which
 and the manner in which the Data is processed or (ii) process the Data for its
 own purposes (other than for aggregated, analytical purposes which the Customer
 hereby authorizes). Rapid7 will have in place and maintain throughout the term
 of this Agreement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect
 the Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss,
 alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful
 forms of processing. In this Section, the terms "controller", "processor" and
 "personal data" will bear the meanings given to them in European Union Data
 Protection Directive 95/46/EC.

 to render systems and services unavailable to authorized users. Customer
 specifically agrees that the Software will only be used to target devices under
 the authorized control of the Customer and in a way in which damage to systems
 or loss of access or loss of data will create no liability for Rapid7 or any
 third party.  Customer further agrees to strictly comply with all federal,
 state and local laws and regulations governing the use of network scanners,
 vulnerability assessment software products, hacking tools, encryption devices,
 and related software in all jurisdictions in which systems are scanned or
 scanning is controlled.

 any of its authorized users is subject to restrictions as set forth in this
 standard license agreement for the Software. If for any reason, Sections
 12.212, 227.7202-1 or 227.7202-3 are deemed not applicable, then the
 Government's rights to use, duplicate or disclose the Software are limited to
 "Restricted Rights" as defined in 48 CFR Section 52.227-19(c)(1) and (2) (June
 1987), or DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(14) (June 1995), as applicable. If this
 Agreement fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any
 respect with Federal law, the government agrees to return the Software, unused,
 to Rapid7. Manufacturer is Rapid7 LLC, 100 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02110.
 .
 12.6. Relationship of the Parties.  Rapid7 and Customer are independent
 contractors, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making them
 partners or creating the relationships of employer and employee, master and
 servant, or principal and agent between them, for any purpose whatsoever.
 Neither party shall make any contracts, warranties or representations or assume
 or create any obligations, express or implied, in the other party's name or on
 its behalf.
 .
 12.7. Force Majeure.  Except for the obligation to make payments,
 nonperformance of either party shall be excused to the extent that performance
 is rendered impossible by strike, fire, flood, governmental acts or orders or
 restrictions, failure of suppliers, or any other reason where failure to
 perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party.
 .
 12.8.  No reliance. Customer represents that it has not relied on the
 availability of any future version of the purchased product or any future
 product in executing this Agreement or placing any orders hereunder.

 contain or be accompanied by certain third party hardware and software products
 or components ("Third-Party Products").   Additional information about
 Third-Party Products may be set forth in the Product Order Form, the Third
 Party Product packaging and/or in a text file, installation file or similar
 file or folder accompanying the Software ("Third-Party Notices"). The
 Third-Party Notices may include important licensing and warranty information
 and disclaimers. Customer acknowledges that Section 10 of this Agreement shall
 not be applicable to the Third-Party Products.
 .
 12.10. Publicity. Customer acknowledges that Rapid7 may use Customer's name and
 logo for the purposes of identifying Customer as a customer of Rapid7 products
 and/or services, including in Rapid7's quarterly press releases highlighting
 new customer engagements.
 .

 by this Agreement must be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered upon
 receipt when delivered personally or upon confirmation of receipt following

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or to which
 You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
 limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
 License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
 with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
 any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
 version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
 include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
 Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create or to
 which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
 of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
 accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
 Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
 Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
 it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
 version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
 recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
 remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
 by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code to which
 you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
 that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
 statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
 Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
 ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
 (a) Third Party Claims.  If You have knowledge that a party claims an
 intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
 utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source
 code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making
 the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
 you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
 described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
 copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
 notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
 obtained.
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs.  If Your Modification is an application programming
 interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
 implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
 of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,
 where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
 one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
 notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such
 notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be
 likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
 for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
 recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
 not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
 absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute Covered Code in
 Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
 that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
 version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
 Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
 Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
 recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
 Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
 with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
 does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
 version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
 Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
 that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
 the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
 other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
 of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
 then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
 possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
 description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
 must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
 notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 6.1. New Versions.  Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
 version number.
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.  Once Covered Code has been published under a
 particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
 terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
 terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg
 No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms
 applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works.  If you create or use a modified version of this License
 (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
 Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so
 that the phrases "FreeImage", `FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any
 confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
 otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which
 differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
 shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
 FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
 LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
 DISCLAIMER.

 .
 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
 You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
 are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
 which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
 License shall survive.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
 CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
 PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
 MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
 PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
 INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
 LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
 LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
 computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212

 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions (except to
 the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
 party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,
 the The Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
 relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
 property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the
 losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to
 this Agreement shall be held in Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation

 construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
 Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of
 Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such
 rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
 distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
 member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing

 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
 rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
 Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
 this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
 upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
 remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
 requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
 You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
 parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
 parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
 reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
 associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
 copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
 consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
 identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
 translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
 original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
 that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
 will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
 or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
 For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
 by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
 explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
 endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
 as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
 express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
 Attribution Parties.
 .
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
 derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
 the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
 jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
 in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
 deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
 action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
 Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
 fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
 to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
 (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
 Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
 any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
 withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
 required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
 License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
 stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
 and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
 License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
 appear in any communication from You.
 .
 e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
 of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
 for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
 September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
 the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
 rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
 which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
 corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
 provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
 rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
 not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
 included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
 license of any rights under applicable law.
